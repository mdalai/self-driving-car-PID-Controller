## CTE (Cross Track Error) algorithm

![alt text][pid_algorithm]

- **Proportional control**: steer the car based on the proportion of the distance from the center of road. This distance from the center of road is alse called CTE. For example, if P=0.1 and the car is off to the left, this will steer 10% of the CTE to the right direction ( opposite direction). If we take a bigger proportion, it will cause strong overshooting problem.
- **Differential control**: 
- **Integral control**:
